    "title": "1 Hour LSTM for all data",
    "description": "LSTM is a type of model which specializes in NLP. LSTM is used in Natural Language Processing because it has the abilitiy to forget and remember context for words. This is the model created by the flock guy. Prediction is made and training is done using 1 hour data. 15 minute data is used insted for this.",
    "pros": ["This is a very simple model and is very easy to create", "It gives rough idea of how an algorithm can perform", "It is faster to train than the 1 hour model and probably performs better"],
    "cons": ["Only a single feature is used to perform prediction. Price of the last 24 days is the only feature used. Other factors influence the price too but they are not used", "Creating a training test split like this is too general for a trading algorithm", "The model is too general. Nobody uses a single model over the entire data and uses it to trade.", "Hedge funds require reasoning behind logic. This algorithm buys and sells but the model is too blackbox. There is no explanable reason behind that for now" , "Machine Learning uses various hyperparameters. How long to train, how much data to use as training and test, what optimizing algoritm to use, how many layers to use and more. Running a search algorithm for this can take these. For the lack of better word, these parameters were pulled out of the ass"]
