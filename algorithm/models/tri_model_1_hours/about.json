    "title": "1 hour LSTM for all data",
    "description": "LSTM is a type of model which specializes in NLP. LSTM is used in Natural Language Processing because it has the abilitiy to forget and remember context for words. This isthe model created by the flock guy. The flock guy makes prediction and trains using 1 hour data.",
    "pros": ["This is a very simple model and is very easy to create", "It gives rough idea of how an algorithm can perform"],
    "cons": ["The cost function used in regresison is not optimal. In Machine Learning we penalize the algorithm when it is wrong so we can predict right. But say the current price is 15$. Our model predicts 20$ or 14$. The price becomes 17$. However 20$ is a better prediction than 14$. We would be right about direction and we don't need to know exact price. But our model penalizes both in the same way.", "Only a single feature is used to perform prediction. Price of the last 24 days is the only feature used. Other factors influence the price too but they are not used", "Creating a training test split like this is too general for a trading algorithm", "The model is too general. Nobody uses a single model over the entire data and uses it to trade.", "Hedge funds require reasoning behind logic. This algorithm buys and sells but the model is too blackbox. There is no explanable reason behind that for now" , "Machine Learning uses various hyperparameters. How long to train, how much data to use as training and test, what optimizing algoritm to use, how many layers to use and more. Running a search algorithm for this can take these. For the lack of better word, these parameters were pulled out of the ass"]
