    "title": "Strategy 2 - Normal Method but more agressive",
    "description": "This backtesting algorithm uses regression metric. The model should have predicted what the value will be in the next timeframe. So if it is greater than the current price, 10 stake of the electricity is brought. If it is negative we sell (if there is already a position). Once we have brought, we do not buy again unless we have sold it. Also this algorithm only considers trading this single asset. Not other cities.",
    "pros": ["This is a very simple model and is very easy to create", "It gives rough idea of how this algorithm can perform on backtest", "Buy buying and selling small amount, risk is managed"],
    "cons": ["A  better way would be to buy based on confidence. If the prediction is very high buy more than 1 stake and buy lesser when its low.", "It only trades single asset. A better solution would be to create a portfolio buying and selling multiple asset and also buy negatively correlated asset and or buy the one which is forecasted to go highest to take down the risk of the portfolio", "Although some kind of risk is manged, it is not a scientific method. A more mathematical appraoch would be better."]
